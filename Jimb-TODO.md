Post-game fixes / polish
* (2024) add support for multiple fonts with different heights to dialog system and/or markdown - handwriting font would be cool
* (2024) Simple way to do dialog as pure text data, and then just add code callbacks the get ran beyond the go-to-dialog
* Things to merge into base toolkit:
  * sound_data.ts
  * music ticking and pulling music from level props
