PLAYER'S PLANNING
[ ] Find where THE ASCENDING RESEARCHER is docked
  * via bribe [stretch: or by following him around the station from a big enough distance]
[ ] Get past the guard
  * via bribe or very hard combat (requires best gear in shops and locations and a lot of consumables)
[ ] Open the safe
  * via Safe Combination obtained via bribe (stretch: or a very hard, timed lockpicking minigame)
[ ] Disappear into the black
  * via cash paid to the appropriate captain

LOCATIONS
* space station
  * armor shop
  * weapon shop
  * general store?
  * department of nutrition processing (buy new chicken hats)
  * med-bay
  * talk to people in bar/cantina/around the station
    * each person has a 1-line, non-modal dialog if they have no interesting interactions, a one-time, multi-step dialog if something more interesting needs to happen, and then a different 1-line to remind you what's next / if they're complete
    * NPC1 offers to trade info on which bay THE ASCENDING RESEARCHER is docked in, wants a KEYITEM1
    * After a bribe of cash, THE BELEAGUERED ASSISTANT offers to trade you the SAFE COMBINATION in exchange for a KEYITEM2 (something to start a new life?)
    * (once you've met THE ESTRANGED GUARD) NPC3 offers to tell you THE ESTRANGED GUARD wants a DAZZLING GIFT (implied: to give to his wife)
    * THE SHADY CAPTAIN says to come by his ship in bay Z later to discuss an off-the-books transport
  * NPC4 in a shop says which planet KEYITEM1 are found on
  * SIGN in a shop says which planet DAZZLING GIFT are found on
  * giant ship docking bay with numbered bays
    * going into the right ship you meet THE ESTRANGED GUARD
* docked ship (same map for all ships, probably)
* danger locations (ideally each a separate style/environment, can all be similar if we run out of time):
  * probably they're all similar in flow with enemies protecting a treasure
  # find the KEYITEM1
  # find the KEYITEM2
  # find the DAZZLING GIFT
